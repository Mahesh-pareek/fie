- add one edit tag option for a given transaction!
- store the dependencies in the .toml !
- currently summary shows the personal summary only, but itshould show all type of analysis
    like summary -a ( all) else net scope wise, if -p ( or full name) then personal and so on 
- in edit i want to ignore the transcations less then 20rs ( noise and coffee are ignored)


##############

- during edit it iterates over all the transactions, suchha lengthy task
- there should be some way to skip ( if i click enter while editing, it keep the exisiting tags)
- also how do i find the transcation id?


############
the inputs and other commadns can be made more easier to run from the CLI efforts should be put on this!!
- make the CLI simplar and update help functions!!


####################################
- currently it shows the payment  mode ( like UPI/IMPS) we don't want that often, so better if you show the auther as well

- ahh the thing is in the counter party they are storing UPI/IMPS, but clearly that should go in mode not in the counter party!! fix it
- counter party should be used for the name of the user who's involved in the transaction ( clearly/?)


##############################

TO DO:
- Add an instruction to not add duplicate files/ overlapping files  else the transactions will be doubled
